## 🛠️ Setup

For complete setup instructions, see [docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md](docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md)

### Quick Start
1. **Database Setup**: Import `database/schema.sql`
2. **Update Schema**: Run `php database/update_schema.php`
3. **Create Admin**: Run `php database/init_admin.php`
4. **Access**: Visit `http://localhost/student-monitoring/public/`
5. **Login**: Use admin@example.com / password

### PWA and subfolder deployment

### 📦 Base-Path Awareness & Helper Usage
All asset and navigation URLs now use helper functions (`Url::to`, `Url::asset`, `Url::publicPath`) for full base-path awareness.
The system works seamlessly when deployed in a subfolder (e.g., `/student-monitoring`).
Service Worker, manifest, and offline page are base-path aware and portable.
Troubleshooting and setup guides updated to reflect these changes.
Tip: After pulling updates, hard reload twice to activate the new Service Worker. In Chrome DevTools → Application → Service Workers, you can click “Unregister” then reload.
