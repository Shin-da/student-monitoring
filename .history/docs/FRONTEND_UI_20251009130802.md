# Frontend UI Guide - Smart Student Monitoring System

This document describes the current frontend UI scaffolding, views, components, and expected backend integration points. It serves both frontend and backend developers to align on data contracts.

## Overview

The UI is built with Bootstrap 5 and custom CSS (`public/assets/app.css`). All dashboards share `resources/views/layouts/dashboard.php`. Public pages use `resources/views/layouts/app.php`.

Dark/Light theme support and responsive layout are included by default.

- Reusable components: `.surface`, `.stat-card`, `.action-card`, `.table-surface`
- Utilities for forms, tables, badges, and cards

## Backend Integration Contracts

The UI currently uses placeholder data. Backend should expose endpoints compatible with these shapes.

### Grades

- Create Grade
  - Method: `POST /grade`
  - Body (application/x-www-form-urlencoded or JSON):
    - `student_id: number`
    - `subject_id: number`
    - `grade_type: 'ww' | 'pt' | 'qe'`
    - `grade_value: number (0-100)`
    - `quarter: 1|2|3|4`
    - `remarks?: string`
  - Response: redirect on success (server-rendered) or `{ success: true, id }` (AJAX)

- List Grades (table filters)
  - Method: `GET /grade`
  - Query params: `student_id?`, `subject_id?`, `grade_type?`, `quarter?`, `date_from?`, `date_to?`, `page?`
  - Response (server-rendered view) should receive `grades[]` with:
    - `id, student_name, subject_name, grade_type, quarter, grade_value, created_at`

- Student Grade Summary (student/parent view)
  - Method: `GET /api/grades/summary?student_id=...&quarter?`
  - Response JSON:
    ```json
    {
      "overallAverage": 85.2,
      "passingSubjects": 8,
      "needsImprovement": 2,
      "improvementRatePct": 3.2,
      "subjects": [
        {
          "name": "Mathematics",
          "overall": 87.5,
          "breakdown": { "ww": 85, "pt": 88, "qe": 90 },
          "status": "passed"
        }
      ],
      "items": [
        {"subject":"Mathematics","type":"ww","description":"Algebra Quiz #1","score":85,"max":100,"pct":85,"date":"2024-01-15"}
      ]
    }
    ```

### Students

- List Students
  - Method: `GET /students?search?=&grade_level?=&section?=&page?`
  - Response view data:
    - `students[]` with `id, name, email, lrn, grade_level, section, status, enrolled_at`

- Create Student
  - Method: `POST /students`
  - Body: `first_name, last_name, email, lrn?, grade_level, section_id, birth_date?, phone?, address?, parent_*?`
  - Response: redirect to `/students` with flash message

- Show Student
  - Method: `GET /students/{id}`
  - Response: view with detailed student profile

- Update/Delete Student
  - Methods: `PUT /students/{id}`, `DELETE /students/{id}`

### Auth & Role Guards

- All dashboard routes require `Session::get('user')`
- Teachers/Advisers: access to `/grade` and `/teacher/alerts`
- Students/Parents: access to `/grade/student-view`
- Admin: access to `/students` and admin modules

## Wiring Views to Routes (Server-rendered)

Add routes in `routes/web.php`:

```php
use Controllers\GradeController;
use Controllers\StudentController;

$router->get('/grade', [GradeController::class, 'index']);
$router->post('/grade', [GradeController::class, 'store']);
$router->get('/grade/student-view', [GradeController::class, 'studentView']);

$router->get('/students', [StudentController::class, 'index']);
$router->post('/students', [StudentController::class, 'store']);
$router->get('/students/{id}', [StudentController::class, 'show']);
```

Controller methods should call `$this->view->render('grade/index', $data, 'layouts/dashboard');` etc.

## Frontend Validation

- Basic client-side validation is in place for required fields and ranges
- Backend must re-validate and return safe errors

## Print and Accessibility

- Student grade view includes basic print styles
- Use semantic HTML and ensure contrast for dark/light themes

## Micro-interactions & Loading

- Animated counters: Any element with `data-count-to` (and optional `data-count-decimals`) will animate to its target value. Powered by `public/assets/app.js`.
- Progress animations: Add `data-progress-to="87.5"` to a progress bar's `.progress-bar` to animate width on first paint.
- Skeleton loaders: Add the `skeleton` class to placeholder blocks while data loads; remove it after real data is rendered.
- Scroll entrance: `.surface` and `.action-card` fade-in on first entry to viewport.

### Demo loading behavior (to be replaced by backend events)

In `grade/index.php` and `student/index.php` we added a short demo swap (700–750ms) that hides skeleton rows and shows real table content after `DOMContentLoaded`. Replace these with real data-load events once wired to the backend.

Example (replace timeout with actual data-ready logic):

```javascript
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function(){
  const sk = document.getElementById('studentsSkeleton');
  const body = document.getElementById('studentsBody');
  // Replace this timeout with: fetch(...).then(() => { sk.style.display='none'; body.style.display=''; })
  setTimeout(() => { sk.style.display = 'none'; body.style.display = ''; }, 750);
});
```
